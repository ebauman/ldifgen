# LDIF Generator

WIP.

Basic tool to generate big-ass LDAP directories.

I was unsatisfied with what I found in the wild to accomplish this task.

Specifically, it seems that everyone has been focused on large user counts but not necessarily complex structures like
deep OUs, many users in many groups, things like that.

So this is my attempt to address those needs.
